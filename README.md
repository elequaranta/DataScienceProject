## Abstract: 
This report presents a possible solution to a classification problem regarding intent detection from audio recordings. This solution is based on the spectral analysis of audios, performed by means of a spectrogram that is split into a defined number of blocks. Each block is then used to extract a summary of statistical properties used by the classification model. The result will be evaluated in terms of accuracy of the predicted intent of each recording. 


## Fileguide:
